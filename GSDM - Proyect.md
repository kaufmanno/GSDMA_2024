### Problem Statement

- **What is the problem we want to solve?**
    - Compute all the possible ways to go from one point to another via bus + walking.
    - Present the possible ways and their times.

### Solution Approach

1. **Data Sources**
    
    - Use Geodata to model walkable paths and the bus network (GTFS files and OSM data).
2. **Network Accessibility**
    
    - Determine how to access the bus network (e.g., isochrone maps to identify reachable bus stops).
3. **Route Determination**
    
    - Calculate possible routes through the network (using Dijkstra's algorithm).
4. **Performance Metrics**
    
    - Define criteria for route optimization:
        - Shortest travel time.
        - Fewest transfers.
        - Maximum allowable walking distance.
5. **Visualization of Routes**
    
    - Design how routes will be presented to users:
        - Interactive maps, static maps, or step-by-step instructions.

### Potential Obstacles

1. **Code Optimization**
    
    - Ensure the code is efficient to handle multiple route calculations quickly.
2. **Low Precision in GTFS Location Data**
    
    - Address potential inaccuracies in location data for more accurate routing.
3. **Edge Cases and Data Gaps**
    
    - Plan for scenarios like route closures, inaccessible areas, or regions outside the immediate network:
        - Implement fallback options if routes canâ€™t be generated due to data gaps.
